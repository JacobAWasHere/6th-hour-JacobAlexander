#1. Print "Hello World!"
print("hello world")
#2. Create 3 variables that each randomly generate a number between 1 and 10, named A, B, and C.

#3. Print A, B, and C on the same line.

#4. Make an if statement that prints if variable A is greater than, less than, or equal to 5.
if a > 5:

#6. Make an if statement that prints if variable C is even or odd.
if c % 2 == 0:

#7. Create a variable whose value is 3 + a randomly generated number between 1 and 20

#8. Make an if statement that prints if the variable from #7 is greater than, less than, or equal to A + B + C.
